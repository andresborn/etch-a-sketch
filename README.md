### Part of The Odin Project Curriculum

###### WebDev 101

I hadn't coded for about two weeks when I started this project so I struggled with remembering some DOM methods. I initially tried to draw the grid using flex, but finally found Grid to be much more useful. Took me about a day and a half. Will return to clean code, make it prettier and add some extra functionality once I am more experienced.

The objective was to create everything using DOM manipulation with JS. The html file only contains a <div class='container'></div>. Everything else is added with DOM.

Things I learned doing this project:

- DOM manipulation
- CSS Grid
